# blui-react-native

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components?label=%40brightlayer-ui%2Freact-native)

This blui-react-native leverages the power of yarn workspaces to manage a collection of Brightlayer UI React Native libraries and example projects within a single codebase. This approach, known as a monorepo, offers a structured and efficient way to develop and maintain multiple interconnected projects. Yarn Workspaces is a feature that allows users to install dependencies from multiple package.json files in subfolders of a single root package.json file, all in one go.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

Clone the Repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-native.git
```

Install Dependencies:

```shell
cd blui-react-native
yarn install
```

This will install all dependencies for the monorepo and its libraries.
