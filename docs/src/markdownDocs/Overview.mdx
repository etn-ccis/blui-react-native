# React Native Themes Overview

This package, `@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes`, provides [React Native](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper) themes for Eaton applications using the Brightlayer UI design system with React Native. We offer two theme options: a Blue theme (standard) and a Dark theme.

# What Do The Themes Look Like?

Have a look at the component theme explorer below to learn how Brightlayer UI themes work at a high level. Here we showcase the components that most fully represent Material Design and Brightlayer UI, and how our themes affect them.

# Installation

## For New Projects

We encourage you to create a new project with [Brightlayer UI RN CLI](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-native-cli-templates/blob/master/README.md#react-native-cli-templates). The CLI is a tool that can generate a bare bones React project that includes all essential Brightlayer UI packages, including the Brightlayer UI themes.

## For Existing Projects

To integrate the package into an existing project, you may install it with npm:

<CodeBlock code={`npm install --save @brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes`} language={'sh'} />

or yarn:

<CodeBlock code={`yarn add @brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes`} language={'sh'} />
