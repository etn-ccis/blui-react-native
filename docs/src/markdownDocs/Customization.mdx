# Customizing Your Theme

When you need to modify a component style across an entire application, theme customization is a great way to tune the default Brightlayer UI theme to exactly what your brand design calls for.

# Extending the theme

<CodeBlock
    language={'jsx'}
    code={`import * as React from 'react';
import { Provider as ThemeProvider} from 'react-native-paper';
import * as BLUIThemes from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes';


const theme = {
  ...BLUIThemes,
  // Specify custom property
  myOwnProperty: true,
  // Specify custom property in nested object
  colors: {
    myOwnColor: '#BADA55',
  },
};

export default function Main() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider  theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}`}
/>



# Writing a New Theme

Most of the time, you should be able to extend on top of our existing themes so that you can maintain your customization while benefiting from any future package updates from Brightlayer UI. However, if you want to build your own theme from scratch, you can fork our [themes repository](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-native-themes/tree/master), change it to fit your branding needs, and use your new theme in the `ThemeProvider`.
