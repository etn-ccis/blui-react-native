# Channel Value

The `<ChannelValue>` component is used to display a channel value (and units). This component abstracts the styles used to display the channel and units as well as an optional inline icon. These are used as part of the [Hero](/components/Hero/api-docs) component, but can also be used inline (e.g., in a list)
