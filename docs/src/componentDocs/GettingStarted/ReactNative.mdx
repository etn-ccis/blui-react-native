# Getting Started with Brightlayer UI

The following instructions will guide you through starting a new Brightlayer UI project using React. Alternatively, you can also start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/etn-ccis?q=blui) (the Login or Navigation examples are good projects to start from).

# Generating a New Project with the Brightlayer UI React Native Templates

The fastest way to start a new Brightlayer UI project is to use the [Brightlayer UI React Native Templates](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/resources/developer). This will automatically create a starter project for you with all of the necessary Brightlayer UI dependencies pre-configured. To start a React Native project use any of these 3 different configurations:

<CodeBlock code={`npx react-native init MyApp --template @brightlayer-ui/react-native-template-blank-typescript
npx react-native init MyApp --template @brightlayer-ui/react-native-template-routing-typescript
npx react-native init MyApp --template @brightlayer-ui/react-native-template-authentication-typescript`} language={'sh'} />

You will be asked to provide a name for your project and whether you want to use the Brightlayer UI eslint and prettier configuration files.

The Brightlayer UI CLI will automatically include:

-   Brightlayer UI Component Library ([@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package//@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components))
-   Brightlayer UI Themes ([@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes))
-   Brightlayer UI Icons ([@brightlayer-ui/react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-vector-icons))
-   Brightlayer UI Colors ([@brightlayer-ui/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors))
-   Brightlayer UI ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config) / [@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config))

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Brightlayer UI React Native Templates documentation](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-native-cli-templates?tab=readme-ov-file#react-native-cli-templates).

# Integrating Brightlayer UI into an Existing Project

Before taking the following steps, you'll want to make sure that you have an existing application. If you used the Brightlayer UI Templates to start your project, these steps have already been done for you automatically.

## Including the Component Libraries

### Brightlayer UI Components

Additionally, we have a [supplemental library](/components/component-catalog) of components designed specifically for Brightlayer UI applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:

<CodeBlock code={`npm install --save @brightlayer-ui/react-native-components`} language={'sh'} />

or

<CodeBlock code={`yarn add @brightlayer-ui/react-native-components`} language={'sh'} />

## Adding Brightlayer UI Themes

By default, your application will be themed to use the [Brightlayer UI theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes).

# Additional Information

## Code Formatting / Style

Brightlayer UI provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the Brightlayer UI team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-code-standards).

> NOTE: the ESLint package is only available for TypeScript projects.
