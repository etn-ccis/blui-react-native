## Hero

A `<Hero>` is used to call attention to a particular value or parameter. It adds some additional visual elements onto a [Channel Value](/components/channel-value/examples). When showing multiple heroes, they are typically placed within a Hero Banner to help with layout.

<HeroBanner />

## Showing Multiple Channel Values

By default, a Hero renders a single Channel Value. If you need to support multiple Channel Values, you can pass them in as children.

<HeroWithChannelValue />

## Adding a Channel Value Icon

If you want to include an inline icon, specify it in the Channel Value `icon` prop.

<HeroWithSecondaryIcon />
