## Auto Complete

The basic `<AutoComplete>` is a standard text input that shows a filtered list of available options as you type.

<AutoComplete />

## Allowing Custom Tags

If you would like to allow the user to enter their own custom values without being restricted to the suggested options, you can use the `allowCustomTag` prop.

<AutoCompleteCustomTags />

## Selection Limits

You can adjust the limitations on the selections with the `limitTags` (sets how many options can be selected) and `tagCharacterLimit` (limits how many characters can be used in a custom option) props.

<AutoCompleteLimitTags />
