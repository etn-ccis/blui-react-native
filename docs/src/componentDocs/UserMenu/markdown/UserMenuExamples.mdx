## User Menu

The `<UserMenu>` is a combination of an avatar and a MUI Menu that is used to hold user account-related information and actions. It is typically located in the top corner of your application within a toolbar.

<UserMenuToolbar />

## Alternative Avatar Formats

The User Menu supports multiple avatar formats (text, icon, image).

<UserMenuAvatarFormat />

## Adding a Menu Header

You can add a header to the top of the menu by passing menuTitle and menuSubtitle props. The avatar will also appear in the menu header.

<UserMenuHeader />

## Using a Bottom Sheet

On larger screens the User Menu opens as a dropdown, but on smaller screens it opens as a bottomsheet. You can customize the point where this transition occurs via the useBottomSheetAt prop.
You can also add the background color of the bottom sheet, the color of text for the bottom sheet header and menu items, and the color of icons for the bottom sheet menu items.
