## Drawer Nav Group

A `<DrawerNavGroup>` organizes related navigation items together. You can have as many groups as needed.

<DrawerNavGroup />

## Spacing the Groups

If you want to add an extra space between your groups, you can use a [Spacer](/components/spacer/examples) component.

<SpacingNavGroups />

## Customizing the Title

By default, each nav group has a simple string as the title. You can customize this and pass in your own content through the `titleContent` prop.

<CustomNavGroupTitleContent />

## Composition vs Configuration

You can define the [Drawer Nav Items](/components/drawer-nav-item/examples) that you want to appear in each group via composition (simply add them as children) or configuration (define them in the `items` prop). Composition will offer slightly better re-rendering performance when props change, but using the `items` prop is easier to read/maintain, especially if you have a large number of items.

<DrawerNavGroupComposition />
