# Using Icons in Brightlayer UI React Native Components

There are two ways you can include icons in your application. The first is passing an [icon as a prop](#icon-as-a-prop) to the component and the other way is using[ `Icon` component](#icon-as-a-component) from `@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components` package as a child to the component.

## Icon as a prop

> For icon usage before v6.0.0, [check here](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-native-component-library/blob/master/docs/IconWrapper.md).

Many Brightlayer UI components support the use of icons. These components will support passing in an icon in a variety of different formats.

| Prop Name        | Description                                                  | Type                                                         | Required | Default      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| family           | Which library to draw the icon from                          | `'material'` \| `'material-community'` \| `'brightlayer-ui'` | no       | `'material'` |
| name             | The name of the icon to use                                  | `string`                                                     | yes      |              |
| allowFontScaling | Should the icon size scale with the system font size         | `boolean`                                                    | no       | `true`       |
| direction        | How the icon should respond to changes in language direction | `'ltr'` \| `'rtl'` \| `'auto'`                               | no       | `'ltr'`      |

When specifying 'brightlayer-ui' as the `family`, icons will be drawn from the [@brightlayer-ui/react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-vector-icons) package. When specifying 'material' or 'material-community, icons will be drawn from the [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) package.

When specifying the `direction`, 'auto' means that the icon will appear flipped for RTL and unflipped for LTR languages. 'ltr' will always appear unflipped, and 'rtl' will always appear flipped, regardless of language direction. Refer to our [internationalization](<https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/patterns/internationalization#bidirectionality--right-to-left-(rtl)-support>) guidelines for more information on which icons should flip.
