## Icons

Icons are visual indicators usually used to describe action or intent.

## Icon as a prop

Many Brightlayer UI components support the use of icons. These components will support passing in an icon in a variety of different formats.

## Icon as a Object

The simplest way to use a icon in a component is to specify the icon as a simple object.

<IconAsObject/>

## Inline Functional Component

You can also use an inline functional component to render other components. This can be especially useful if you want to render something other than a Material, Material Community, or Brightlayer UI icon, such as a progress icon.

## String as a Icon

In some rare cases, you may wish to pass a simple string (e.g., a single letter or number) as the icon for a component. In this case, you may pass a string directly to the icon prop. This can also be used to render emoji icons.

## Image Source

The icon prop will also support images in various formats, either from local resources or from the web.
